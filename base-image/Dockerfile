# We use ONBUILD (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild)
# to support triggering certain behavior when specific files exist in the directories of our
# child images (such as base-notebook, pangeo-notebook, etc). For example,
# in pangeo-notebook/Dockerfile, we *only* inherit from base-image:master, and
# that triggers all these ONBUILD directives - it is as if these ONBUILD
# directives are located inside pangeo-notebook/Dockerfile. This lets us
# keep the Dockerfiles for our child docker images simple, and customize
# them by just adding files with known names to them. This is
# to *mimic* the repo2docker behavior, where users can just add
# environment.yml, requirements.txt, apt.txt etc files to get certain
# behavior without having to understand how Dockerfiles work. We use
# ONBUILD to support a subset of the files that repo2docker supports.
# We do not use repo2docker itself here, to make the images much smaller
# and easier to reason about.
