# Build a custom image

Advanced users may want a highly customized environment that still works on Pangeo BinderHubs. You can do that by building off the pangeo `base-image` following our [template repository example](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-binder-template). Further documentation on the configuration files in the `binder` subfolder can be found in the [repo2docker documentation](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#configuration-files).
